**Quality Model** ("is based on", "mentions"): ISO/IEC 25010

This paper proposes a quality analysis from an empirical point of view. It uses three tools for quantitative analysis: SonarQube, PMD and FindBugs. The quality metrics are not proposed per se in the paper, but are useful candidates.

The paper mentions ISO/IEC 25010 software product quality characteristics. These are:

* functional suitability
* performance efficiency
* usability
* portability
* compatibility
* reliability
* maintainability
* security

The following table shows how each tool tackles different metrics. However, some are not defined:

|Abbr.| Tool      | Metric|
|:---:|:---------:|:-----:|
| CS  | SonarQube | Number of code smells|
| PD  | PMD       | Empty code, Naming, Braces, Import statements, Coupling, Unused Code, Unnecessary, Design, Optimization, String and StringBuffer|
| FB  | FindBugs  | Dodgy code, Bad practice, Malicious code, Performance, Correctness, Security, Multithreaded correctness, Internalization|

**Quality Model** ("is based on", "mentions"): ISO/IEC 9126

The paper presents a standardized measurement model based on the ISO/IEC 9126 definition of maintainability and source code metrics.
In this ISO standard they propose a hierarchical quality model made of quality characteristics decomposed in subcharacteristics.
They choose 6 code properties as key metrics for the quality assessment of the subcharacteristics.
Then they keep a benchmark database to perform comparison and evaluate new measurements. In this database they use metadata attributes to tag each measurement and help with comparing.

The quality characteristics from ISO/IEC 9126 they mention are:

* Analysability: measured with Volume, Redundancy and Unit size.
* Changeability: measure with Redundancy, Unit complexity and Module coupling.
* Stability: measured with Unit inteface size and Module coupling.
* Testability: measured with Unit complexity and Unit size.

They present a metric suite called the Software Testing and Reliability Early Warning metric suite for Java (STREW-J) that can be used as an early indication of an external measure of software application quality. They put a greater emphasis on internal software metrics, particularly those involving the testing effort. It requires the existence of an extensive suite of automated unit test cases being created as development proceeds.

**Quality Model** ("is based on", "mentions"): Extends ISO9126, Dromey and McCall models

Comment

The study proposes a systemic quality model. Authors developed a process framework with which to evaluate product quality considering the processes that contribute to product
quality. They basically extend ISO 9126 product quality model considering the roles of stakeholders (project managers, developers, and users) trying to evaluate the internal quality,
which includes functionality, reliability, usability, efficiency, maintainability, and portability characteristics. Authors claimed that those quantities relate to each other and must
be integrated for a systemic global quality design. The work does not analyze the effect of the method applied on different stakeholders.

| 144      | ESQUT | It is a source code quality index  |  Quantitative            |  (old) C code  | MT        | See below  |

**Quality Model** ("is based on", "mentions"):

The paper's main motivation is that Halstead's and McCabe's metrics are not practical and have some limitations (in the case of programs with GOTO statements and deep nesting). The authors propose a new quantitative metric called ESQUT-C (for C programs) considering:

* n. of GOTO statements
* n. of module exits
* n. of conditional statements
* n. of procedure blocks
* nesting level of procedure blocks
* number of executions
* number of lines (LOC)
* number of real digits

They also showed how those metrics correlate with McCabe's and Halstead's metrics.
The paper has been published in 1990.

**Quality Model** ("is based on", "mentions", "defines"): define Boehm software quality model

The article describe the Boehm software quality model. It identifies characteristics of quality structured in a tree (see above for this characteristics). It also gives a few example of quality metrics (Boehms wrote a book on the subject). It also explains the link between the identification of types of error and when they appear during the software life-cycle and at which phase of the cycke they are corrected. It shows that early application of automated and semiautomated consistency, robustnes and self containedness checkers leads to significant improvements in software error detection. It gives some input on quality-enhancing tools and techniques. Life cycle activities with significant effects on software quality:

* setting software quality objectives and priorities
* performing software quality benchmarking
* using software quakity checklists
* establishing an explicit quality assurance activity
* using machine-analyzable software specifications
* ensuring testable software requirements
* using a requirements-properties matrix
* establishing standards
* using an automated code auditor for standards compliance
* performing design and code inspections

**Quality Model** ("is based on mentions")

**NOTE: This article is mainly on context definition and its role in the process of software quality evaluation** 

This article describes the impact on software quality management as reported by several organiztions that have an ISO9000 certification. What has been the impact
in the quality management of their software that can be attributed to being certified ISO 9000. The survey was centered in five elements: code reviews and inspections,
software testing, product and process measurements, measurement of quality cost and demonstrations of quality improvement. Most critics are around the lack of real 
impact in the time-to-market strategies for software products, and to the burden they generate to the developers due to the exceisve "top-down approach" and 
centralized management quality management approach of the ISO 9000 system. Excesive load of documentation production for auditing purposes is also a problem 
reported by the companies involved in the analysis. Aspects such as moral and motivation of the programmers are not considered.

**Quality Model** ("is based on mentions")

**NOTE: This article is mainly on context definition and its role in the process of software quality evaluation** 

The paper descrbes an extension of the ISO 9126 model os software quality, based on the findings of the project QUINT (Quality in Information Technology). 
The extension includes non-technical concepts in the software usablity ccriteria such as learnability, explicitness, clairty, helpfulness, user-friendliness. 
The results were tested by the software teams of several companies dedicated to software development, and conclusions are available in the handbook of the 
project summary. The methodology described is now embedded in the DevOps paradigms, specially concerning the need of independent testing and validation processes.
